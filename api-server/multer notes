Yes, you can summarize Multer's role in your application as follows:

Multer is a middleware for handling file uploads in Node.js/Express applications. In your case, you've configured Multer to save images uploaded by users to the public/Images folder on your server. It takes care of receiving the uploaded files, renaming them to ensure uniqueness (e.g., appending a timestamp to the original filename), and storing them in the specified destination folder.

So, you can say that Multer's primary function here is to manage the image upload process, ensuring that the images are saved in a specific directory on your server, making them accessible for future use in your application.
